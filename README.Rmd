<!-- badges: end -->

Use GitHub Actions continuous integration to plot WHOI near-real-time whale buoy (RTWB) detections for various species in the Mid-Atlantic Flyway.

## Data sources
  -   RTWB
  -   Natural Earth
  -   USA critical habitat
  -   CAN critical habitat
  -   Slow zones

## Desired output
  -   Table with columns:
      -   date
      -   species
      -   detected
      -   slow_zone_id
      -   slow_zone_active
  -   Figures (5; 4 facets, 1 per species):
      -   All:
          -   Coastline in OMERC projection
          -   Critical habitat polygons
      -   Yesterday: 4 plots, 1 per species
          -   RTWB location filled if present, point if absent
          -   slow zone polygon filled if active, transparent if not
      -   2 days ago
      -   One-week running mean
